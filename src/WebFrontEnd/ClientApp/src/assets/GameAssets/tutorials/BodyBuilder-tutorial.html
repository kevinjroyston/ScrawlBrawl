<h1 class="Tut-Title">Body Builder</h1>
<p class="Tut-Title">Create your champions from a collection of heads, bodies and legs.</p>
<h3>Stage 1 - Draw Some Body Parts</h3>
<p>You will be asked to draw an assortment of body parts: heads, bodies and feet.<br /> Just follow the prompt at the top of your device.</p>

<p>Were you asked to draw a head? How about a baseball player, a scientist, an alien, even a fishbowl.</p>

<p>Legs? Are they wearing fancy shoes? Bare feet? BEAR feet? Put them on a surfboard, have them running or riding a unicycle.</p>

<p>A faint stencil appears showing you a sample head, body or legs.<br />

    <img src="/assets/GameAssets/game-images/BodyBuilder-Icon-Legs.png"> <br /> They are just for reference, you don't need to trace them. They will NOT appear on your final drawing. But pay attention to where the stencils meet the top and bottom of the
    image. The final pictures will look much better if the necks and legs line up.</p>

<p>Complete ALL of your drawings within the time limit. Notice the timer at the top shows how much time and how many drawings you need to complete.</p>


<h3>Stage 2 - Create Titles</h3>
<p>This is a battle of champions.&nbsp; You create the categories.&nbsp; </p>

    &nbsp; Who will be the first to walk on Mars.<br /> 
    &nbsp; Worldâ€™s worst dog-walker.</font></i><br/> Tip: Hit the SUGGEST button, you won't lose any points.</p>

<h3>Stage 3 - Body Building</h3>
<p>It's time to assemble your champion.<br /> Look at the battle prompt and scroll through the provided heads, bodies and legs to create the your hero.</p>
<h3>Stage 4 - Describe Your Champion</h3>
<p>Give your champion a name, title or description.&nbsp;&nbsp; Often times a clever description will tip the votes in your direction.</p>
<h3>Stage 5 - Voting</h3>
<p>Look at the shared game viewer to see the champions vying for the title.&nbsp; Vote on your device.</p>
<h3>Points</h3>
<p>You get points if your champion receives votes.</p>
<p>You also earn points if other players use the body parts you created.</p>
