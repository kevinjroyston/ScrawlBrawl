<h1>Body Builder</h1>
<p>Create your champions from a collection of heads, bodies and legs.</p>
<h2>Stage 1 - Draw Some Body Parts</h2>
<p>You will be asked to draw several body parts.&nbsp; Your device will say "Draw a Head" or "Draw a Body".</p>
<p>Complete ALL of your drawings within the time limit.</p>
<p>A light outline of the body part will appear in the drawing box.&nbsp; Don't simply trace that outline, use it as a guide for where the neck and the legs line up.</p>
<p>You are not limited to drawing people.&nbsp; Create alien body parts, animals, or inanimate objects so long as the neck and legs line up.</p>
<h2>Stage 2 - Create Titles</h2>
<p>This is a battle of champions.&nbsp; You create the categories.&nbsp; </p>
<p>"World's best dog walker"<br /> "Least likely to succeed"<br /> "Intergalactic Space Hero"</p>
<p>Tip: Hit the SUGGEST button on top to cycle through some suggested categories.</p>
<h2>Stage 3 - Build A Body</h2>
<p>It's time to assemble your champion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at the prompt and scroll through the provided heads, bodies and legs to create the your hero.</p>
<h2>Stage 4 - Describe Your Champion</h2>
<p>Give your champion a name, title or description.&nbsp;&nbsp; Often times a clever description will tip the votes in your direction.</p>
