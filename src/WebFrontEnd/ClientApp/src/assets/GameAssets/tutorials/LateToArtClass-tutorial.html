<h1>Late To Art Class</h1>
<p>Art class has started and you have no idea what topic was assigned. Take a peak at your neighbor's artwork and guess the assigned topic.
</p>
<h2>Stage 1 - Drawing Prompts</h2>
<p>You will enter some art class drawing topics.</p>
<h2>Stage 2 - Draw</h2>
<p>You will either receive a drawing prompt, or you will be "late to class" and have missed the prompt.<br> If you're late, you'll have to copy off of your neighbor's artwork. But don't simply recreate their image or everyone will know you copied. Try to
    determine the topic and draw your own image </p>
<h2>Stage 3 - Find the Latecomer</h2>
<p>Look at the works of art and determine who showed up late for class and copied off their neighbor.</p>
<h2>Points</h2>
<p>You gain points if you can spot the late student (partial credit if you find who they copied from).</p>
<p>You lose out on some points if people incorrectly think you were the late student.</p>
