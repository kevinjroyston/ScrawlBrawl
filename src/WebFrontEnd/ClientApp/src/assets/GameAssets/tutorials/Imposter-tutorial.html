<h1>Imposter Syndrome</h1>
<p>You are going to ask everyone to draw a picture, but you are going to create a special prompt for one random player (the Imposter).&nbsp; The goal is to come up with a pair of prompts where you can tell which drawing was the imposter, but no one else
    can.
</p>
<h2>Stage 1 - Prompt Creation</h2>
<p>You will be asked for two prompts: one for everyone and one for the imposter. If you are confused, simply hit the SUGGEST button!</p>
<p>Examples of good prompts</p>

        <tr>
            <td class="tut-imposter-top">Prompt for Everyone</td>
            <td class="tut-imposter-top">Prompt for the Imposter</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="tut-imposter-even">Racecar</td>
            <td class="tut-imposter-even">Pickup Truck</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="tut-imposter-even">Basket of fruit</td>
            <td class="tut-imposter-even">Banana</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

<h2>Stage 2 - Drawing</h2>
<p>You will be asked to draw something... so, draw it.&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't have to be a masterpiece, just get the idea across.</p>
<p>Be careful not to talk too much during the drawing round or else you may divulge crucial information to the other players.</p>
<h2>Stage 3 - Voting</h2>
<p>Take a close look at all the drawings.&nbsp; Remember what your drawing prompt was... do they all fit that pattern?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose the drawing you think was the imposter. But be careful, YOU might be the imposter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Points</h2>
<p>Everyone earns points for correctly picking out the imposter.</p>
<p>You also earn points for blending in.&nbsp; Every vote for someone else gives you a few points.</p>
