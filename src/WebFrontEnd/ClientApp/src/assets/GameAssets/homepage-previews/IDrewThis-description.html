    Throughout history, great artists often had an apprentice lay down the tedious basic brush strokes allowing them to focus on the central figures. In OverDrawn you will alternate between apprentice and master. Unfortunately your studio is so busy that
    drawings get confused. Your commission may be to paint the King and Queen, but your apprentice hands you a canvas showing the Jester riding a donkey. With no time to start over, you make the best with what you have.</div>
