    Maybe you're a budding artist excited for your first art class. Maybe you're just fulfilling a stupid college art requirement. Regardless, you're late. Class has started and you have no idea what topic was assigned. Sneak in the back, plop your canvas
    onto the easel and pretend you've been there all along. Take a peak at your neighbor's artwork and guess the day's assignment. FINALLY, a game that captures the highs and lows, the trills and chills of being... Late to Art Class.
