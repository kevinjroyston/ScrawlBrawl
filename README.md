## To play over LAN / WiFi
THIS FLOW HAS NOT BEEN USED IN SOME TIME

Disclaimer: Running this project in this manner involves adding an exclusion to your firewall which may put your computer at risk of an attack. Proceeding with the steps below is an acknowledgement that you understand, accept, and take responsibility for the risks and potential negative outcomes. Also note, it has been many months since this flow has been tested/needed.
  - Add an inbound firewall rule to allow inbound TCP on the port you plan to use (ex: 50403)
  - Edit the ApplicationHost.config file to include a binding for your LAN IP (ctrl+f 'localhost' and add a new entry)
  - Run Visual Studio as an administrator (otherwise IIS express can't be bound to your LAN IP)
  - Ensure the server and client are on the same wifi, enter 'http://[yourip]:[yourport]' in a web browser
